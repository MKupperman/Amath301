    "I didn't learn how to do deep learning in `keras`, the tensorflow APIs. I used `pytorch` and it's taught by CSE 546. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for everyone who wants to learn the fundamental of machine learning, take a look at CSE 546/446. You can petition into the class with the prereq, and even better, CSE 546 is open for petition (Not sure about 446). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially good if you are in other deparments who are interested in learning about the fundamental of machine learning, both in a a prectical sense, and a theoretical sense. \n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, CSE 546 is an advanced class, and for those who lacks some background, feel free to take STATS 390, MATH 394, CSE 163 to get a complete background for the class, and it should help with the petition too. \n",
